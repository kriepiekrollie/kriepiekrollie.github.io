            <h1> Mathematics </h1>

            <p> I've been doing mathematics for fun as long as I can remember. </p>

            <p> When I was 8 I started doing Origami as a hobby, which eventually evolved into folding polyhedra out of their nets in my free time. </p>

            <p> After that, I found the YouTube channel "Numberphile" and I realized that I loved maths. </p>
              
            <p> 
              This was a blessing and a curse since I became much better at maths because it was fun for me,
              but all of my math classes at school became boring and I didn't have any friends who could relate. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually I started doing mathematics olympiads and got to make like-minded friends which was really epic.
            </p>
            <p> 
              In 2023 I started studying maths at Stellenbosch University and now I hate it.

            <h1> Gaming </h1>
            
            <p> Gaming is a hobby that goes hand-in-hand with liking computers </p>
            
            <p> My favorite games include osu!, Minecraft, Counter-Strike, Stardew Valley, Among Us and Factorio. </p>

            <p> Recently I was recommended Genshin Impact and I don't know how to feel about it. </p>
